## About

ServUP is a lightweight, open-source, and easy-to-use deployment tool designed to simplify the process of deploying artifact from GitHub Actions to remote servers. It provides a simple and efficient way to manage your deployments, ensuring that your applications are always up-to-date and running.

### Features

ServUP uses SSH to securely transfer files from your GitHub Actions workflow to your remote server.

## Installation

In order to work with ServUP, you need to do some configuration on your server and your GitHub repository.

### Server Configuration

Install ServUP on your server via the command-line with curl:

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S2009-dev/ServUP/main/tools/install.sh)"
```

This will create a `servup` user on your server and open a specific port for SSH connections (`1424` by default).  
Ensure that you've copied the ServUP SSH Key given at the end of installation.

If you have a firewall, make sure to open the port given at the end of installation.  
You can trust only GitHub Actions IPs, they are listed in the `actions` section of the [GitHub meta API](https://api.github.com/meta).  
We provide a script to help you configure your firewall if you are using `iptables`. See [Iptables Support](#iptables-support) for more information.

### Repository Configuration

**1. Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:**

- `SSH_HOST`: The IP address or domain name of your server.
- `SSH_PORT`: The port used by ServUP for SSH connections (default: `1424`).
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of the `servup` user on your server.

**2. Implement the ServUP Deployment workflow:**  
Add the following step to your workflow:

```yml
- name: ServUP Deployment
  uses: S2009-dev/ServUP@latest
  with:
    artifact: <ARTIFACT>
    run-id: ${{ github.run_id }}
    remote: /var/lib/servup/<REMOTE>
    deploy: /var/www/<DEPLOY>
  env:
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    SSH_HOST: ${{ secrets.SSH_HOST }}
    SSH_PORT: ${{ secrets.SSH_PORT }}
    SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

Or if you want to use the development version:

```yml
- name: ServUP Deployment
  uses: S2009-dev/ServUP@latest
  with:
    artifact: <ARTIFACT>
    run-id: ${{ github.run_id }}
    remote: /var/lib/servup/<REMOTE>
    deploy: /var/www/<DEPLOY>
  env:
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    SSH_HOST: ${{ secrets.SSH_HOST }}
    SSH_PORT: ${{ secrets.SSH_PORT }}
    SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

Replace `<ARTIFACT>`, `<REMOTE>` and `<DEPLOY>` with your own values.

- `<ARTIFACT>` is the name of the artifact generated by your workflow (ex: `my-artifact`).
- `<REMOTE>` is the remote directory where the artifact will be uploaded (ex: `my-remote`).
- `<DEPLOY>` is the directory where the artifact will be deployed (ex: `my-deploy`).

:warning: **Warning:** Currently only apache2 deployment is supported.

## Annexes

Here you will find additional tools and resources to help you use ServUP effectively.

### Iptables Support

If you are using `iptables` as your firewall, you can use the following command to open the ServUP SSH port:

```sh
servup-firewall
```

Or if it's not working:

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S2009-dev/ServUP/main/tools/firewall.sh)"
```
